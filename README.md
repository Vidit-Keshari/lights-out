# Vidit: lights-out
## Lights Out - Game
This is an old-fashioned game which remixed by VGames with same functionality but different theme!

## Lights Out - Game Rules
Here are the rules of the game:-
- The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of cells.
- Your goal is to turn off all the cells to win.
- Green cells are ON, and blue cells are OFF.
- Turning all cells ON results in a loss.
- Click on a cell to toggle its state.
- Clicking a cell also toggles its adjacent neighbors (above, below, left, and right).
- Plan your moves strategically to turn off all the cells!
- Game resets automatically after 2 seconds if a win or lose is detected.
- Clicks are disables on win or lose.

## Old series
I have started a new series named Old Series. I will be uploading games like this which were played by people earlier but in a new style.
This is its first game.

## Version histoy:-
### Improved styles v.2.2
- Changed layout to match the layout of 2048
- Changed the colors of sections for same reason
- Added settings section
- Added background music
- Optimized moon as in the latest versions of Vidit: Old Series: 2048
- Added a notes section. (which is not styled properly)

> All the other games coming in Old series collection will follow this same style.
>
> If you are wodering why 2048 does not follow this game's style when this came earlier then for your information I started 2048 first and then this. 
> But this finished earlier. So I uploaded it first.
>
> The newer version will bring more improved styles and responsivness for mobile users. Stay tuned!
